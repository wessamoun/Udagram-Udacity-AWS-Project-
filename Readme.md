# Hosting a Full-Stack Application


In this project we will take a newly developed Full-Stack application built for a retailer and deploy it to a cloud service provider so that it is available to customers. we will configure the services the application needs such as a database to store product information and a web server allowing the site to be discovered by potential customers.

we will then register for a free account on CircleCi and connect your Github account to it. Based on the manual steps used to deploy the app, we will write a config.yml file that will make the process reproducible in CircleCi. we will set up the process to be executed automatically based when code is pushed on the main Github branch.
